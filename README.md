# Zack's Animal Crossing: New Horizons Diary
![https://animalcrossing.zackboe.hm](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7c03fac05af7e3708cbc3bb32ab75156667eb4a7/68747470733a2f2f7a302e6c742f6b4465)

## What?
This is an [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) site on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) that builds on commit. Images added to `images_diary` are compressed and added to a diary collection based on their date+app based filenames. Events are pulled from my [Notion document](https://www.notion.so/zackboe/Animal-Crossing-4d8938aac8854b42ad10d8097d152d94) through [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) where I track upcoming events and their rewards.


### TODO:
- Notion API pls
- Better archive (total/year/month) pages
- Passports pages?
